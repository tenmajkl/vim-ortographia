# vim-ortographia

This plugin converts staples to diacritics, just like Jan Hus did in his Orthographia Bohemica.

## Motivation

Vim in my opinion works better with english keyboard, but when you need to write in czech, you need to switch keyboards or shoot in foot.

It doesnt directly use staples from old czech, it uses combination that make sence.

## Instalation

tbd

## Development notes

It was hard not to try to be funny and name this repo eg. kostnice.
